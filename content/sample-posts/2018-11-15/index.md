It's been one hell of a year and we wanted to have one last chance to get together and geek out to discuss all things development.  
Huge apologies for the short notice but we genuinely have some really fantastic speakers lined up and this is certainly one event not to 
be missed.  

Once again the good folk at D'alRae Solutions are hosting us, so major props to them for helping make this such a great event.   

Finally we have some huge news as one of our core team has decided to make trails and switch allegiance to the blue side of the east coast 
from the good old maroon side.  To celebrate everything he has done for this event and to give him a great send off please come along.

# Session Overview

## Session 1: ABAP in the cloud 
### ( Graham Robinson - SAP Mentor )
Graham captivated us all last time with his talk on ABAPGit.  With the most recent developments SAP decided that ABAP deserves a place in the cloud 
and Graham is here to help explain what that means.  


## Session 2: Our journey into the world of CDS
### ( Surya Reddy )
Come join us for a session on how our goal to support the implementation of ABAP applications using ABAP CDS views was achieved at one of our large public-sector clients. Along the way we will show you some of the technical capabilities of CDS views and compare it with the traditional approach of application development using core ABAP.
