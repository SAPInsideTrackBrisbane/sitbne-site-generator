In this session we plan to have three speakers discuss the topics from SAPUI5, SAP Build and one more topic soon to be finalised by a guest speaker

# Session Overview

## Session 1: SAP Build for Rapid Prototyping

The discovery stage of a project has the potential to cost or save a lot of money, as changes become much more expensive during and after development. Using rapid prototyping, designers are able to incorporate user feedback, and refine functionality before any development begins; allowing developers to spend more time on quality. For companies heavily invested in SAP, it is worth considering product specific prototyping tools, such as SAP Build. The more focused scope of Build offers a number of advantages over general prototyping tools, with a lot of the leg work being automated or guided. For us, this meant that prototypes could be completed within a day of the initial discussion, and end users' feedback could be incorporated quickly and easily.

Lachlan Magee will discuss and demonstrate some of these capabilities of SAP Build.

## Session 2: Demystifying the art of component reuse in SAPUI5

One of the things I’ve always found being really complex was component reuse. This means to use one app inside another. In this discussion, I (Jakob Kjaer) will try my best to demystify this, as it really isn’t that hard at all.


## Session 3: To be announced shortly

We have a really great speaker lined up and they are finalising their topic of choice.
