# Get in touch with us
We'd love to hear from you if you are keen to share something with the community.  Topics are not exclusive to SAP related stuff, but extend to any of the cool things you may be working on or have worked on and want to share.  

If we love your request, we'll get back in touch with you to arrange speaking at one of the future sessions we will arrange.  Remember there are no barriers to entry, except yourself from getting in touch with us.

## What we want

Please send us your contact details, the title and a short summary of the topic you wish to share with the group.  You can drop us a mail or complete the [google form](https://goo.gl/forms/NiQ9uWiXf6B9nBWI2) to submit your reference application. 


## What we don't want

Sadly we don't want any sales pitches, this is not really the right forum for one of those.  Our aim is to keep this as a knowledge sharing and networking event.  You should maybe consider registering for one of the Mastering SAP or ASUG events which are better geared towards sales.
