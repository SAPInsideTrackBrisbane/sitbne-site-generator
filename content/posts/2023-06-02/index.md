Well a lot has happened since we last got together.  We had a glorious line up tee'd up back in 2021, but covid hit and ended face to face meetups as we knew it.  It's now 2023 and we're so happy the world is now back to normal(ish).  Post covid ending, it's taken us a little while longer to get back into the swing of things, but I'm so pleased to announce that we're finally ready to come back & we're doing it with a bang.  

We've managed secure two top drawer speakers in [Volker Buzek](https://twitter.com/vobu) and [Mauricio Lauffer](https://twitter.com/mauriciolauffer) for our next event on the 2nd June 2023.      

Volker has been a prominent member of the SAP Community for many years. You would know him for being involved with all the cool things going on in the world of UI5.  He's currently working on a book "SAP UI Frameworks for Enterprise Developers: A Practical Guide" with Marius Obert.  

Mauricio is a very talented individual, who only recently relocated from Sydney to Brisbane.  He's written an awesome blog post on [how to automate SAP BTP provisioning and configuration with Terraform!](https://blogs.sap.com/2023/01/23/automating-sap-btp-setup-with-terraform-infrastructure-as-code-for-cloud-foundry-and-kyma-environments/), which I highly advocate you read to learn more about Infrastucture as Code.
