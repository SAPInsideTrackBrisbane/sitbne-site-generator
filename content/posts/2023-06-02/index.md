Well a lot has happened since we last got together.  We had a glorious line up tee'd up back in 2021, but covid decided to come and ended all good social meetups.  It's now 2023 and we're so happy the world is now back to normal(ish).  Post covid ending it's taken us a little while longer to get back into the swing of things.  But I'm so pleased to annouce that we're finally ready to do this.  

We are working hard on getting some real top draw presenters for our next event on the 2nd June 2023.  Keep watching this space or our social for more updates on speakers.  

If you're keen to get involved, have a free space we could use or could help sponsor us, we'd absolutely love to hear from you.
