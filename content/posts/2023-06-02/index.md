Well a lot has happened since we last got together.  We had a glorious line up tee'd up back in 2021, but covid decided to come and ended all good social meetups.  It's now 2023 and we're so happy the world is now back to normal(ish).  Post covid ending it's taken us a little while longer to get back into the swing of things.  But I'm so pleased to annouce that we're finally ready to do this.  

We've managed secure two top drawer speakers in [Volker Buzek](https://twitter.com/vobu) and [Mauricio Lauffer](https://twitter.com/mauriciolauffer) for our next event on the 2nd June 2023.      

Volker has been a prominent member of the SAP Community for many years and you would know him for all the cool things going on in the world of UI5.  He's currently working on a book "SAP UI Frameworks for Enterprise Developers: A Practical Guide" with Marius Obert.  

Mauricio is a very talented indiviual, who only recently relocated from Sydney to Brisbane.  He's written an awesome blog post on [how to automate SAP BTP provisioning and configuration with Terraform!](https://blogs.sap.com/2023/01/23/automating-sap-btp-setup-with-terraform-infrastructure-as-code-for-cloud-foundry-and-kyma-environments/)  which I advocate you read to learn more about Infrastucture as Code.  

Once we are able to provide more details on their talks, we'll push out more updates via this post and via our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_sitbne) account . 

We'll have a link up shortly for tickets too with details of our venue too.  

If you're keen to get involved, have a free space we could use or could help sponsor us, we'd absolutely love to hear from you too.
