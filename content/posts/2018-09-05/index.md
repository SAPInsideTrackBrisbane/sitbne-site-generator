In this session we have talks lined up from Mike Doyle and Jason Lante. 

Huge thanks to Chris Rae and the good folks at D'alRae Solutions for hosting us.  


# Session Overview

## Session 1: What ABAP & UI5 devs need to know about the SAP Cloud Platform SDK for iOS
### ( Mike Doyle )
The SAP Cloud Platform SDK for iOS helps us to build native iOS apps that connect seamlessly to back-end systems like S/4HANA and ECC. Mike will
talk us though what we need to know to help us get started.  For more details you should also check out his [SAP Community blog post](https://blogs.sap.com/2018/08/09/sdk-for-ios-your-quick-start-guide/) on the topic


## Session 2: Modern ABAP Development Techniques
### ( Jason Lante )
Since 7.40, ABAP has been significantly improved to make your code more efficient. Jason's talk will help you learn how to write simplified ABAP code leveraging techniques from other programming languages.

You can access the teched content "DEV262 â€“ Evolution of the ABAP Programming Language - Karsten Bohlmann, Holger Janz & Thomas Jung" that Jason references in his talk <a href="https://sitbne.github.io/media/2018-09-05/E3_Presentation_ Evolution of the ABAP Programming Language" download>here</a>

Another excellent reference are Horst Keller's blog posts with the Language News for each ABAP release.  Jason refers specifically to this classic post for the [ABAP Language News for Release 7.4](https://blogs.sap.com/2013/07/22/abap-news-for-release-740/).
