Sorry we've left you waiting so long for the latest session.  But to make it up to you we've lined up two fantastic speakers.  So come join us on June 27th for an awesome night. We are just working through some details around their talks and as soon as any updated content is available, we will push it out the sitbne website.

## Session Overview

### Session 1: Fiori Elements â€“ Metadata Driven UI ( NON MASTER CLASS )

Leigh has a wealth of experience in the industry working on various projects on cutting edge deliverables. He's joining us from Sydney to give a presentation on Fiori Elements.

If you have not seen a Fiori Elements development from end to end ( OData Annotations on SAP Gateway using CDS Views to SAP Web IDE Fiori Elements Template ) this session will get you up and running with the basics.

This is not a master class, we will cover a basic List Report use case so you can see how all the pieces hang together and if we have time introduce the concept of Data Control Language for data level security restriction.

### Session 2: SAP & Chatbots

Creating an interactive way to get data out of SAP and databases using chatbots.
