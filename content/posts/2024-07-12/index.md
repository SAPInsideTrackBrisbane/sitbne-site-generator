In our day to day conversations with various members of the community, we find we're constantly discussing the future direction of SAP Development.  

Topics vary from things like:
- Should I learn CAP?
- What's happening to all of my ABAP when I move to the cloud?
- What does cloud really help to do, that I can't already do using ABAP?
- What is SAP doing to consolidate the technology landscape for analytics?
- Will AI take over my job?
- What's the best way to learn all of these new technologies? 
- Isn't cloud really expensive?  
- As a basis consultant what will I do now that devs can manage and deploy infrastructure using code

We've realised that these are all really important discussions that many in the community want to discuss, but don't always find the right opportunity to do so.  

We think it's important to have access to an open forum, to ask questions and share opinions for all the things that we are thinking about in terms of the future state of SAP Development.  

## Session Overview
For this reason we've decided to change up the format of this event.  This session we plan to run more as an AMA (Ask Me Anything) style event. However rather than asking to a specific individual, you'll be pitching to the wider group to share their thoughts and experiences.  

### Main Session
The SITBNE team & key community members, including [Alex Bauer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexba) (Head of Analytics & Insight Services SAP ANZ) will be sat down amongst you to help drive the discussion & of course provide guidance on our collective experiences.    

We'd like to invite you along to grab a drink, share a slice of pizza & join us in the conversation.

To help keep the conversations flowing & directed to things important to you, we ask attendees to anonymously submit any questions/topics they'd like to discuss at the event. The full list of responses can be found below.
