In our day to day conversations with various members of the community, we find we're constantly discussing the future direction of SAP Development.  

The topics vary from things like:

- Should I learn CAP?
- What's happening to all of my ABAP when I move to the cloud?
- What does cloud really help to do, that I can't already do using ABAP?
- What is SAP doing to consolidate the technology landscape for analytics?
- Will AI take over my job?
- What's the best way to learn all of these new technologies? 
- Isn't cloud really expensive?  
- As a basis consultant what will I do now that devs can manage and deploy infrastructure using code

We've realised that these are all really important discussions that many in the community want to discuss.  

It's important to have an open forum, to ask questions and share opinions for all the things that we are thinking about in terms of the future state of SAP Development.  

## Session Overview
For this reason we've decided to change up the format of the event.  This session we plan to run more as an AMA (Ask Me Anything) style event.  

We'll have a small panel composed of the SITBNE team & key community members, including Alex Bauer (SAP) to sit amongst you and drive the discussion.    

We'd like to invite you along to grab a drink, share a slice of pizza & join us in the conversation.

To keep the conversations flowing, we'd like to invite you to submit any questions/topics you'd like to discuss.  We've created an anonymous form that you can use to submit your questions/topics that we can collate before the event starts.
