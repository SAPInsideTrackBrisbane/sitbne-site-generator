This session we'll have two great talks lined up from two great speakers.

First up will be Liam Mischewski from SAP talking about SAP Build Code. Liam has a long track history in SAP & currently resides in the Custom Advisary Team as an Innovation Architect. You may know him from some of the tech hubs & code jams run last year.

Our second speaker is Lochner Louw from Dalrae Solutions. Equally Lochner has an impressive track record in SAP architecture & development.  He's got a depth of experience on BTP and CAP development & a keen eye to help optimise your application processes.

## Session Overview
